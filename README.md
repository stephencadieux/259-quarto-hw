Quarto Homework

PSYC 259: Principles of Data Science

Instructor: John Franchak

## Objective

Convert a heavily-commented R script into a more-nicely formatted (and still functional) Quarto report.
In the folder, you will find `data-wrangling-example.R`.
This was an example I used for another class, where I made lots of comments about the data structure, wrote code and comments for the data cleaning/merging, and I also provided the answers for how to do a few EDA things (steps 3A and 3B).
I have included an example of roughly what the final report should look like called `eda_quarto.html`.

## Steps

1.  In R Studio, create a new Quarto document that will output to html.
2.  Copy the comments and code over from `data-wrangling-example.R` to your new Quarto file. Turn the text into markdown prose, and put the code into code chunks. Look at the example document to see whether code/results should be shown vs. hidden.
3.  Do this a little bit at a time and periodically knit your document to make sure it's working correctly.
